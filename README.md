# PASO-with-realtime-traffic-prediction
This project is for my internship in The Chinese University of Hong Kong, which focuses on 
the timely transportation of long-haul heavy-duty trucks across the national highway system.
This project can be divided into two stages.
##The first stage is designing an algorithm of routing and speed planning,which utlizes the historical traffic speed information.
##The second stage is using machine learning approach to do _traffic flow prediction_.
